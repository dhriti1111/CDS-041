# ðŸ’» C++ and Data Structures (CDS) Lab â€“ Semester 3

This repository contains all the C++ programs written as part of our *CDS Lab (C++ and Data Structures)* conducted during the current semester. So far, we've completed 5 experiments that cover the basics of C++ programming, including syntax, data types, operators, and decision-making.

All files are named clearly and organized for quick reference and reuse. Scroll down to check out the theory behind each experiment!

## ðŸ§ª List of Experiments

### ðŸ”¹ Expt 1: Hello World and Calculator Program

*Purpose*:  
- To get familiar with the structure of a C++ program.
- To implement a basic calculator performing arithmetic operations.

*Concepts Covered*:
- Header files, main() function, input/output (cin, cout)
- Arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /, %
- Using if-else or switch to perform the calculator logic

### ðŸ”¹ Expt 2: Study of C++ Program Structure (Data Types)

*Purpose*:  
- To understand different data types used in C++ and how to declare variables.

*Concepts Covered*:
- Primitive data types: int, float, char, bool, double
- Type modifiers: long, short, unsigned, signed
- Variable initialization and scope

### ðŸ”¹ Expt 3: Operators in C++

*Purpose*:  
- To study and implement various types of operators in C++.

*Concepts Covered*:
- Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %
- Relational operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
- Logical operators: &&, ||, !
- Assignment and compound assignment operators

### ðŸ”¹ Expt 4: Bitwise Operators in C++

*Purpose*:  
- To understand bitwise operations and how they work at the binary level.

*Concepts Covered*:
- Bitwise AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~)
- Left shift (<<) and right shift (>>)
- Practical uses in low-level programming and optimization

### ðŸ”¹ Expt 5: Decision Making Statements in C++

*Purpose*:  
- To apply conditional logic using control statements.

*Concepts Covered*:
- if, if-else, else if, nested conditions
- switch-case structure
- Conditional branching and flow control
